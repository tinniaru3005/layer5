Fortunately, as containerization grows in popularity among developers and IT teams alike, so does the number of tools for managing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of container platforms provide native management functionality: Docker Swarm allows you to use simple commands like swarm stop or swarm pull when your swarm is up-to-date; Kargo automatically manages clusters using zero-touch configuration; Rancher provides tools to manage containers using any infrastructure stack; and Mesos offers both orchestration capabilities through Marathon as well as advanced resource scheduling features. It&amp;#x27;s not always easy to know which platform will work best for your organization, but it&amp;#x27;s important to find one that suits your company&amp;#x27;s needs—especially if IT is looking forward to a future without manual management tasks! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting Started with Kubernetes]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

However, containers cannot be moved between hosts like virtual machines can, so a more robust solution may be needed for this use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because they&amp;#x27;re so lightweight and take up less space than VMs do, containers are great for running lots of them at once! If your application needs more computing power or memory than your machine can provide on its own, using multiple containers in parallel will help balance out any resource shortages without having to invest in additional physical hardware like you would with traditional VM-based deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As they&amp;#x27;re isolated from each other, containers are great for running multiple apps at once without worrying about them stepping all over each other&amp;#x27;s toes! This makes them perfect for things like hosting websites or email services where you want lots of different people to be able to use it at the same time without slowing down or crashing because there&amp;#x27;s not enough resources available for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What&amp;#x27;s more, since they&amp;#x27;re so easy to spin up and take down, they&amp;#x27;re also great for testing out new ideas quickly without having to worry about making permanent changes to your system (or losing any data along the way!). So if you want to try out a new CMS but don&amp;#x27;t want to go through the trouble of installing it on your machine first, just fire up a container with it inside and see how it goes! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One downside to using containers is that they can&amp;#x27;t easily be moved between hosts like virtual machines can, so a more robust solution may be needed for this use case. Fortunately, there are some great open source projects out there that help solve this problem!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Conclusion &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kubernetes is a popular containerization solution that continues to see increasing adoption rates. That being said, using it successfully requires thorough consideration of your workflows and departmental best practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Service Mesh: Istio]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

It is an operational framework that incorporates DevOps best practices for infrastructure automation, including version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD tooling, which are often used for application development. Like code, not only can you store your infrastructure configuration in a source code version system, but you can also take your infrastructure configuration and any changes to its configuration through the same change management process that you do when updating your applications and services. In part, GitOps is about change management, and consequently, it is about risk reduction and risk management. When you automate a process and classify the manner in which you systemize the process, risk is reduced through the consistency and series of processes and reviews changes go through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitOps is the acknowledgement that declarative systems that everything is (or should be) defined as code. With all code in a source code system, that system becomes the source of truth and in the system of record for how your infrastructure is running. Well, that is, assuming that your infrastructure configuration hasn&amp;#x27;t drifted from its desired state defined in your source code system. If Git is the source of truth, you cannot run operations manually by executing random commands. Doing so would mean that Git would stop being the only source of truth. Instead, the only goal of operations is to define the desired state as code and store it in git. Then, let the machines synchronize that with the actual state. Such synchronization must be continuous so that the two states are (almost) always in sync. In other words, GitOps is about defining everything as code, storing that code in Git, and letting the machines detect the drift between the desired and the actual state – and making sure that drifts are resolved as soon as possible, hence resulting in the two states being almost always in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Principles of GitOps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt; 1) Declarative&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to this principle, the entire system should have a declarative description. Let us first understand what a system description is. What is committed to your Git repository is called the System Description. One or more files that define each system component and its state will be included in the system description. According to GitOps, the way in which we store those definitions is crucial, and we must do so declaratively. That implies that the description of our system will be saved as data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the declarative approach, we specify how we want the system to look not how we can achieve that state. If we want to make any changes, we change the description instead of the series of steps to get there. Declarative configuration is critical for GitOps because it provides a description of the system that an automated agent can understand and utilize to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; 2) Single Source of Truth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second principle mandates that we keep that system description inside of Git. Therefore, we decide to maintain the official blueprints, which outline the ideal system state version in Git. A git commit is required if we wish to modify the blueprint. The blueprint can also be called the desired state. This helps developers, testers, operations, security, and automations to have a single reference and keep uniformity in everyone’s vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GitOps also improves a system&amp;#x27;s ability to recover from failure because it&amp;#x27;s simple to roll back an unsuccessful change or restore the entire system from the repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; 3) Automated Change Delivery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only automation allows us to apply modifications made to the blueprint to systems already in operation. Delivery of changes is entirely automatic. GitOps doesn&amp;#x27;t allow manual editing. Because standard workflows only need GitHub, which is such a well-known platform, automation enables changes to be delivered through simpler for developers to use workflows. Additionally, automation standardizes your delivery processes, improving the predictability and consistency of system operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; 4) Automated State Control&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fourth principle uses automation to keep our operating system in alignment with the desired state. Drift is the deviation of the runtime state of our system from the desired state. The system&amp;#x27;s blueprints and what is actually operating in the system don&amp;#x27;t match. Therefore, if the operating system drifts from what we have specified in Git, an operator will restore it by bringing it back to the intended condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Benefits of GitOps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt; 1) Improves compliance and security:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since teams use a single platform for infrastructure management, a streamlined toolchain reduces attack surfaces. Teams can use the version control system to roll back to a desired state in the event of an assault. GitOps lessens outages and downtime as a result, allowing teams to continue working on projects in a secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; 2) Boosts productivity and cooperation:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; GitOps includes CI/CD pipelines, Git workflows, and infrastructure as code best practices for software development.

GitOps workflows streamline procedures in order to improve visibility, establish a single source of truth, and have a small number of tools on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; 3) Automation enhances developer efficiency and lowers costs:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Productivity rises with CI/CD tooling and continuous deployment since teams can concentrate on development rather than laboriously manual processes thanks to automation. Since team members can use any language and tools they like before pushing updates to GitHub, GitOps workflows enhance the developer experience. Infrastructure automation increases output and decreases downtime while enabling better cloud resource management, which can also save costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; 4) Increases stability and reliability:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Human mistake is decreased through infrastructure that is codified and repeatable.

The chart automates Kubernetes&amp;#x27;s Consul service mesh installation and configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Platform Agnostic and Multi-Cluster Mesh&lt;p&gt; Consul works with all cloud providers and architectures. You can expand the scope of your Kubernetes clusters to include services that aren&amp;#x27;t run using Kubernetes by using the service catalog sync and auto-join features. In order to facilitate safe service-to-service communication between Nomad tasks and jobs, Consul additionally interfaces with HashiCorp Nomad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Managing Containers]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

The replication factor is configured by the user, and it&amp;#x27;s the controller’s responsibility to recreate a failed pod or remove an extra-scheduled one. Other examples of controllers are endpoints controller, namespace controller, and serviceaccounts controller, but we will not dive into details here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Worker Nodes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These nodes run the workloads according the schedule provided by the master. The interaction between the master and worker nodes are what’s known as the control plane. The pods are run here, so the worker node contains all the necessary services to manage the networking between the containers, communicate with the master node, and assign resources to the containers scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kubelet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubelet ensures that all containers in the node are running and are in a healthy state.  If a node fails, a replication controller observes this change and launches pods on another healthy pod. Integrated into the kubelet binary is ‘cAdvisor` that auto-discovers all containers and collects CPU, memory, file system, and network usage statistics and also provides machine usage stats by analyzing the ‘root’ container. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubelet gets the configuration of a pod from the apiserver and ensures that the described containers are up and running. This is the worker service that’s responsible for communicating with the master node. It also communicates with etcd, to get information about services and write the details about newly created ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kube Proxy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kube Proxy acts as a network proxy and a load balancer for a service on a single worker node. . It takes care of the network routing for TCP and UDP packets. It forwards the request to the correct pods across isolated networks in a cluster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pod is the basic building block on Kubernetes. It represents the workloads that get deployed. Pods are generally collections of related containers, but a pod may also only have one container. A pod shares network/storage and also a specification for how to run the containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Containers are the lowest level of microservice. These are placed inside of the pods and need external IP addresses to view any outside processes. Docker is not the only supported container runtime, but is by far, the most popular. Docker runs on each of the worker nodes, and runs the configured pods. It takes care of downloading the images and starting the containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;kubectl&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubectl is a command line tool to communicate with the API service and send commands to the master node. kubectl must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you have multiple clusters, you might try using kubectx, which makes switching between contexts easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Managing objects with kubectl&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can divide a Kubernetes cluster into multiple environments by using namespaces (e.g., Dev1, Dev2, QA1, QA2, etc.), and each environment can be managed by a different user. One of the inconveniences of writing kubectl commands is that every time you write a command, you need the --namespace option at the end. People often forget this and end up creating objects (pods, services, deployments) in the wrong namespace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this trick, you can set the namespace preference before running kubectl commands. Run the following command before executing the kubectl commands, and it will save the namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands for your current context:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 evYsys&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dWFHS&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 evYsys prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 jIVRXe&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=mynamespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is Multi-Cluster Kubernetes?]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

Istio has replaced all the familiar Ingress resource with new Gateway and VirtualServices resources. They work in sync to route all the traffic into the mesh. Inside the mesh there is no requirement for Gateways since the services can access each other by a cluster local service name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Let’s understand the working with a representation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/Istio Ingress Gateway No Title-080918fabe90005624619773f1cde554.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Istio Ingress Gateway in Kubernetes No Title&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firstly A request is made by a client on a specific port&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then a load balancer on this port listens and forwards the request to one of the workers in theh cluster on same or a new port&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inside the cluster the request is routed to the Istio Ingress Gateway which is listened on the port of the load balancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Service forwards the requestto an Istio Ingress Gateway Pod which is managed by a deployment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Ingress Gateway Pod is configured by a Gateway and a VirtualService.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Gateway configures all the ports, protocol, and certificates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Virtual Service configures all the routing information to find the correct Servicein it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Istio Ingress Gateway Pod routes the request to the application Service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And lastly, the application Service routes the request to an application Pod which is managed by a deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ingress Gateway Service&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ingress Gateway Service must listen to all the ports to be able to forward the traffic to the Ingress Gateway pods. Here we will be using routing to bring all the port numbers back to their initial state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that a Kubernetes Service is not a real service, but, since we are using type: &amp;quot;NodePort&amp;quot;, all the request will be handled by the kube-proxy provided by Kubernetes and forwarded to a node with a current running pod. Once on the node, an IP-tables is configured a request will be forwarded to the appropriate pod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 evYsys&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dWFHS&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 evYsys prism-code language-yaml&quot;

When a Gateway or VirtualService gets changed, they are detected by the Istio Pilot controller and converts this information to an Envoy configuration and sends it to all the proxies, including the Envoy inside the IngressGateway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since container ports are not supposed to be declared in Kubernetes pods, we don&amp;#x27;t have to declare the ports in the Ingress Gateway Deployment. If we look inside the deployment we can see that there are a number of ports that are already declared anyway. We have to take care about the Ingress Gateway Deployment in SSL certificates.

At their core, service meshes provide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A services-first network; A developer-driven network;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A network that is primarily concerned with alleviating application developers from building infrastructure concerns into their application code; A network that empowers operators with the ability to declaratively define network behavior, node identity, and traffic flow through policy;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A network that enables service owners to control application logic without engaging developers to change its code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value derived from the layer of tooling that service meshes provide is most evident in the land of microservices. The more services, the more value derived from the mesh. In subsequent chapters, I show how service meshes provide value outside of the use of microservices and containers and help modernize existing services (running on virtual or bare metal servers) as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;faqbutton&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItem&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemWrapper-sc-zq6yo-1 kuOBrF accordion__item&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemHeading&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionTitleWrapper-sc-zq6yo-4 cxZhwm accordion__header&quot; role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemButtonWrapper-sc-zq6yo-5 cnOZKH&quot; id=&quot;accordion__heading-raa-5&quot; aria-disabled=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-5&quot; role=&quot;button&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemButton&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__IconWrapper-sc-zq6yo-7 jSKTcX&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;When should I adopt a service mesh?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__OpenIcon-sc-zq6yo-2 eMFVbf&quot;&gt;&lt;svg stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; style=&quot;color:white&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M256 217.9L383 345c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9 0 9.4-9.4 9.3-24.6 0-34L273 167c-9.1-9.1-23.7-9.3-33.1-.7L95 310.9c-4.7 4.7-7 10.9-7 17s2.3 12.3 7 17c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9 0l127.1-127z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__CloseIcon-sc-zq6yo-3 hFGJnU&quot;&gt;&lt;svg stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; style=&quot;color:white&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M256 294.1L383 167c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0s9.3 24.6 0 34L273 345c-9.1 9.1-23.7 9.3-33.1.7L95 201.1c-4.7-4.7-7-10.9-7-17s2.3-12.3 7-17c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l127.1 127z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemPanel&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionBodyWrapper-sc-zq6yo-6 dPsyPB accordion__body&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-5&quot; hidden=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many service meshes to choose from as well as a variety of deployment models.

We expect earnest effort from its contributors. What “earnest effort” means is different for each community member as all have different circumstances. Suffice to say, the more you put into your efforts, the greater your reward will be. Most community contributors stay with the project for many months, if not indefinitely. Length of involvement is entirely up to the individual community member. You can expect to be challenged, to be assisted, to learn, to be recognized for your effort and to have your contributions appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Layer5 community, you are expected to be a good representative of Layer5&amp;#x27;s cultures and values of helping fellow members and paying it forward as we all learn together. You are expected to offer your ideas and skills to help advance our community and its projects. You are expected to share your experiences with others, to be curious, to be helpful, to ask questions, to challenge others and to be challenged yourself, to spread the word about what we collectively do here, to invite new members, to learn, to share, to make friends, to build a network, to write blog posts, to tweet, to become maintainers, to become MeshMates, to earn an internship, to get hired by Layer5 - - any and all of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;faqbutton&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/community/meshmates&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btnstyle__ButtonStyle-sc-mhxpaj-0 iWxbxr appion__btn faqbutton&quot; title=&quot;Reach out to a MeshMate to find out more&quot;&gt; Reach out to a MeshMate to find out more&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItem&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemWrapper-sc-zq6yo-1 kuOBrF accordion__item&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemHeading&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionTitleWrapper-sc-zq6yo-4 cxZhwm accordion__header&quot; role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemButtonWrapper-sc-zq6yo-5 cnOZKH&quot; id=&quot;accordion__heading-raa-19&quot; aria-disabled=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-19&quot; role=&quot;button&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemButton&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__IconWrapper-sc-zq6yo-7 jSKTcX&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;I see works of other contributors being highlighted.

Start contributing and keep contributing. Community members who consistently contribute are the first individuals to be awarded internships when new internship opportunities open up - particularly members who are making significantly impactful contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand that internships are assigned as a recognition of work that you are already performing. They are not assigned in the hopes of you becoming a good contributor, but are awarded to support and reinforce efforts that you are already giving. Engage and make an impact on an area of a project. Show your passion for helping move the project forward, willingness to work hard, and capacity to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognize that there are many hundreds of contributors and relatively few maintainers and MeshMates. If you don&amp;#x27;t get an immediate response, don&amp;#x27;t lose heart.
