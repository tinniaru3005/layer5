Being fairly new to the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to delve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm welcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation jobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the task of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings hosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I finally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted! It still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Next up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being a new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and GraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to expand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a continuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush Trivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have spent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the project goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began helping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to do before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I recently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a MeshMate, which I happily accepted.
