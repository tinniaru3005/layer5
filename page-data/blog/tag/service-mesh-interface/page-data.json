It explains several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), their configuration variables, and their corresponding effect on the service mesh underneath in full detail. What makes SMI vital is that these CRDs are generic, and the specifications are implemented and actively followed up by various service meshes. Some of these service meshes have developed adapters that define SMI CRDs as a wrapper over the APIs they already provide, instead of adhering to the SMI spec internally.
